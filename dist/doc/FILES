FILES

being a description of what each file in the EL distribution is, and
how to use - and NOT to use - them. Does not yet cover the various
EL_* m4 files that comprise the sendmail package, which have their own
documentation, or will. 

Basic caveats apply here: if you don't know what's in it, don't use it
without asking. 

badhelos

	a list of known bad 'HELO' strings; largely unmaintained due to
	there being rules in the sendmail distribution that allow you to
	reject invalid HELO strings (such as Windows hostnames with no TLD
	or those with hi-bit characters in them). If using outside of the
	sendmail package, this should ONLY be used as a full-string match.


bannedmx
bannedns

	contains a list of known MX or NS IPs for spam domains; the idea
	here is that spammers often reuse a single MX IP and the same NS
	IPs across throwaway domains. Relatively unmaintained because it
	wasn't found to be very useful in practice, especially as the spam
	domains aren't usually used in rfc2821 MailFroms, only in the body.
	Use outside of sendmail is discouraged.


bouncers

	contains a list of known "outscatter" or "blowback" sources; this
	is used by the sendmail package to check for blowback, along with a
	check for the MailFrom to see if it's the null sender (or one of a
	few dozen variants on "null" from non-compliant software that tries
	to generate NDNs but sends them from a non-null sender). 


domains

	a list of domains seen in spam; while it is actively maintained (I
	keep adding domains to it), we encourage the use of other, better
	maintained resources such as SURBL or URIBL, for "mass blacklisting"
	of spammer domains. This file is effectively my local domains BL,
	and YMMV as to whether or not it's appropriate for you to use it;
	it was generated from a wide variety of sources, including spam
	corpuses, public blacklists, inbound spam to trap addresses, data
	mining research both public and secret, etc. Use at your own risk.


exim_hosts
exim_hosts_compact

	a list of regexes for known "generic" rDNS naming conventions; 
	the 'compact' version should be used in conjunction with the
	'rightanchors' file or some sub-product, as it strips out any 
	patterns that have "domain tails" or "right-anchored" substrings
	ie ('.dyn.example.com') where regexes aren't necessary, as well
	as a set of "left anchored" patterns commonly seen in generic
	hostnames ie ('^dynamic-\d+'). Will go away when the DNSBL is
	live and out of testing.


geographic

	contains a list of netblocks in "octet" format, originally
	generated from the RIR records that show which netblocks are
	issued to which countries; it's not very well maintained as per
	new additions/allocations, because there are many overrides (eg,
	for known abused/open proxies, generic "africa" listings,
	satellite providers whose IPs are registered to Israel but
	deployed in West Africa). It is used by the sendmail package in
	conjunction with Received/X-Originating-IP/etc. header checks to
	determine the country of origin of messages sent via many commonly
	abused webmail systems, as well as a few large ISPs, to reject
	mail that is overwhelmingly Nigerian 419/advance fee fraud scams.


offwhitelist

	contains a list of known possibly legitimate mailhosts, classified
	in terms of their problems: O for offwhite (we received spam via
	their IP), P for phishing scams (usually compromised webhosts), T
	for "doesn't provide tracking information, such as point of
	injection" so they're commonly abused by 419ers, 419 for known
	sources of 419 spam, L for legitimate mailhost (just a placeholder
	so we can keep them in the file, possibly they cleaned up their
	problems), V for hosts that are legit but have bad virus relaying
	problems, CR for challenge-response sources. Will eventually move
	to a DNSBL lookup. Use at your own risk; this is my local file and
	the entries are maintained more in the addition than in the removal
	once problems are resolved. Think of it as a record of past trust
	issues, rather than as a realtime "this host is BAD NOW" lookup.
	Used in the sendmail package to help score messages based on their
	point of origin.


patterns_xwalk

	contains a crosswalk / reference distribution of the patterns,
	with a key, the pattern, and our best-guess classification as to
	its genericity, static or dynamic assignment, or other more
	specific classifications (eg 'nat', 'wireless', 'cable', 'dsl').
	May be useful in many contexts, but probably most useful as the
	source of the DNSBL's data. 


postfix_regexp_table
postfix_regexp_table_compact
postfix_regexp_table_nested

	contains the patterns, in a format useful for postfix, such as to
	check HELO or PTR in smtpd_client_restrictions. Will go away when
	the DNSBL is live. 'nested' is an experimental format that was
	intended to provide better performance, but which apparently does
	not.


rightanchors

	contains a list of right-anchored substrings and our best-guess
	classifications for their genericity, static/dynamic assignment.
	Used in conjunction with sendmail as an alternate, non-access.db,
	format in order to allow for custom logic and scoring, etc. Use in
	any other context will likely require customization of the format.


sendmail_access_db

	the older, deprecated, version of rightanchors; distributed to be
	used with sendmail's "access.db".


sendmail_rules.m4

	current patterns distribution for sendmail where the patterns are
	to be compiled into a .cf via the .mc file; deprecated in favor of
	the DNSBL, and will no longer be distributed once the DNSBL goes
	live. 


sendmail_rules_config.m4
sendmail_rules_full.m4

	legacy patterns distribution formats; "full" contains ALL of the
	patterns whereas the sendmail_rules.m4 file trims out those with
	rightanchor and compact left-anchor pattern matches. "config" is
	also an alternate, legacy format, an evolutionary step on the way
	to the "canonical" sendmail_rules.m4.

	NOT MAINTAINED and last generated in June 2006.


subset_pats

	yet another alternate patterns distribution format, produced for
	use by a client with far more stringent requirements as per 0
	false positives. It is effectively the full patterns, excluding
	those who we have classified as webhosts, edu/resnets, known
	outmxen and spammers (legacy, because we no longer list any known
	spammer domains). Not currently in use by the client for which it
	was produced, and is not being updated as of January 2007.


test_array

	the set of our test IP/hostname pairs along with the key that
	identifies each within the EL XML patterns database; for use with
	testing currency and freshness of patterns as well as testing
	whether the patterns actually match the hostnames they're supposed
	to match. 


wordlist

	a dictionary, compiled from many sources, for testing for the
	"Mobster I. Syphilitic" ratware, primarily, though now used in
	a few other contexts within the sendmail package. Basically just
	a list of words and names.
